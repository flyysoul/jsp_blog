This blog is based on JSP,JavaBean,Servlet and MySQL.The blog just like
a common blog. However, the main reason why I developed it was that I 
want to count the radio how the visitors like each module and get the 
http information such as referer,ip and so on.

The blog deployed in http://www.chenxiusheng.cn ,but I change the website
to wordpress not so long ago.
